<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Let me introduce myself, Hello, My name is Jesus Hernandez,I am a student at Santa Ana High school Located in the city of Santa Ana,I have some previous experience in computer science for example I took a class in my freshman year for (PLTW) or Project Lead The Way</p>

  <p>I have an award for completing that class called a CTEp witch is a certificate for meeting entry level standerds for employment.Some reasons for taking this course is that I wanted to learn more about programs and how they work and overall increase my knoledge about computer science.</p>

  <p>Some of my personal hobbies and intreast are probobly collecting American football cards, throwing a football around during lunch time and drawing. </p>

  <p>FInally the reasons I underwent taking CS prinicples is becuase I really wanted to learn how to code and make projects of my own I often had a hobbie of making my own video game rather that be in coding or video games I dont do it anymore but I think CS is what caught my attention in creation.</p>
